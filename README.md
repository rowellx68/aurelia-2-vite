# Aurelia 2 + Vite

This a a very basic example of Aurelia 2 and Vite. There are a lot of things that currently do not work.

## What Works

- Running the project in dev mode works. It builds and serves the app.
- Conventions work, no need to import the HTML in the ts file.
- Routing works partially; only `load='/account'` works so far
- Styling works
